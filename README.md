The faster you tap, the higher you go. Each tap represents a wing flap and higher flight. Once you stop, you drop towards the ground.<br />
3.Find your rhythm for higher and lower pipes. This is important when you need to go higher or drop, or else you will hit a pipe.<br />
4.If you hit a pipe or the ground/top of screen, the game ends.<br />
